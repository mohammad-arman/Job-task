                  Melissa Bentivoglio is a classically trained ballet dancer and
                  a renowned pilates and fitness instructor. Melissa credits her
                  dedication to pilates as having changed her life after years
                  of elite level performance. In 2018, she designed her own
                  proprietary reformer for use in her own studio. By launching
                  Frame, she hopes to make pilates more widely available and
                  accessible, so that everyone has a chance to improve their
                  quality of life.
